Ai_Image_Captioner

 Turning images into captions/stories

 
"""

Project: AI-Powered Image Captioning Tool
Description:
An AI-powered image captioning tool using Python, which will generate human-like captions for images uploaded by users. 

Features:

	1	Image uploading: Allow users to upload images (JPEG, PNG, etc.) to the application. Implement proper file validation 
        and size limits to ensure security.
	2	Image preprocessing: Preprocess the uploaded images to make them suitable for analysis by the AI model. 
        You can use libraries like OpenCV, Pillow, or scikit-image for this purpose.
	3	AI model: Train a deep learning model using a pre-trained neural network (e.g., VGG16, ResNet, Inception, etc.) 
        and a recurrent neural network (RNN) or transformer model for generating captions. You can use TensorFlow or PyTorch
        for implementing the AI model.
	4	Caption generation: Integrate the trained AI model with your web application to generate captions for the uploaded images.
	5	User interface: Develop a user-friendly and responsive web interface for the application. 
        You can use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript along with a front-end framework like Bootstrap or Material-UI.
	6	REST API: Create a REST API to enable other developers to use your image captioning service in their applications.



	•	Consider using pre-trained models and fine-tuning them on a dataset like MS COCO for better results.
	•	Use libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch for training and deploying the AI model.
	•	Study and follow best practices for web application security, such as OWASP guidelines.


# Django will be used
# Look into MS COCO dataset

# Lets start with the most difficult part, the AI model


# Next will be the image preprocessing

# Then the image uploading

# Then the user interface/webservice using django
