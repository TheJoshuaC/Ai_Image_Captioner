 Turning images into captions/stories

Project: AI-Powered Image Captioning Tool
Description:
Develop an AI-powered image captioning tool using Python, which will generate human-like captions for images uploaded by users. 
This project will help you gain experience in machine learning, computer vision, natural language processing (NLP), 
and web application development. By the end of this project, you'll have a strong understanding of how to design and implement creative 
AI applications using Python.
Features:

	1	Image uploading: Allow users to upload images (JPEG, PNG, etc.) to the application. Implement proper file validation 
        and size limits to ensure security.
	2	Image preprocessing: Preprocess the uploaded images to make them suitable for analysis by the AI model. 
        You can use libraries like OpenCV, Pillow, or scikit-image for this purpose.
	3	AI model: Train a deep learning model using a pre-trained neural network (e.g., VGG16, ResNet, Inception, etc.) 
        and a recurrent neural network (RNN) or transformer model for generating captions. You can use TensorFlow or PyTorch
        for implementing the AI model.
	4	Caption generation: Integrate the trained AI model with your web application to generate captions for the uploaded images.
	5	User interface: Develop a user-friendly and responsive web interface for the application. 
        You can use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript along with a front-end framework like Bootstrap or Material-UI.
	6	REST API: Create a REST API to enable other developers to use your image captioning service in their applications.


Tips:
	•	Use Flask or Django as the web framework for your backend.
	•	Consider using pre-trained models and fine-tuning them on a dataset like MS COCO for better results.
	•	Use libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch for training and deploying the AI model.
	•	Study and follow best practices for web application security, such as OWASP guidelines.


Completing this project will give you a solid foundation in creative AI applications and full-stack development, 
and you'll have a portfolio-ready application to showcase your skills when applying for a software engineering job.

# Django will be used
# Look into MS COCO dataset

# Lets start with the most difficult part, the AI model


# Next will be the image preprocessing

# Then the image uploading

# Then the user interface/webservice using django
